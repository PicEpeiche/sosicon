# Sosicon v 0.1 (under development)
For Linux, OS X and Windows. Converts SOSI files to a number of other formats, including shapefile.
The parser is still under development.

SOSI is a data format used for exchanging geographical information in Norway. The name is an acronym
for _"Samordnet Opplegg for Stedfestet Informasjon"_, which translates into something like
_"Coordinated Approach for Geospatial Information"_. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSI)
has more.

## Features
*  Swift conversion
*  Selectable feature/objtype/field export
*  Supports command-line piping on OS X/Linux
*  Written in ANSI C++
*  Compiles and runs on OS X, Linux and Windows

## Quick demo
Prebuilt Sosicon binaries are located in the /bin directory of the repo. Choose your OS and put the
executable in a location where it can be run from the command line.

* [Linux executable](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/tree/master/bin/linux)
* [OS X executable](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/tree/master/bin/osx)
* [Windows executable](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/tree/master/bin/win)

You can inspect the content of a SOSI file by using the -stat command, like this:

`sosicon -stat input.sos`

This command will render a list of SOSI elements (geometry types among other things) and SOSI
object types (OBJTYPE).

To convert a SOSI file to shape, run sosicon from the directory where the SOSI file
resides. Use the -2shp parameter to emit the three required files: Shape file (shp), database
file (dbf) and index file (shx). A projection fils (prj) will also be created if the
reference grid is recognized by sosicon.

`sosicon -2shp input.sos`

On Linux and OS X, batch conversion is supported by piping:

`ls *.sos | sosicon -2shp`

The above command will convert every *.sos file in current directory to corresponding shapefiles.
The files will be written to the same directory, keeping the file title extended with feature name,
geometry type and shp/shx/dbf extensions.

Use the -o parameter to specify optional output file basename:

`sosicon -2shp -o ~/myfolder/arealdekke input.sos`

## Build from source code

###Linux/OS X
You need g++ to compile sosicon. To build from source code, check out the git repository, enter the
src directory and run `make`. There's no `configure` or `make install` yet. The binaries will be
output to [bin/linux](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/tree/master/bin/linux) or
<em>[bin/osx](https://github.com/espena/sosicon/tree/master/bin/osx)</em>.

###Windows
Project files for Visual Studio is included in the repository. Open src/sosicon.sln solution
file in Visual Studio (Express) 2013 and build the project from there.

## Development
Sosicon is not ready for release, although SHP conversion works reasonably well with some SOSI features.

## Source documentation
Documentation exists in html, rtf and pdf formats. See the doc directory within the repository or visit [sosicon.espenandersen.no](http://sosicon.espenandersen.no/) for an online version.

The source code documentation for sosicon is generated by the brilliant [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) code documentation tool written by Dimitri van Heesch.

### Ragel parser
The parser in sosicon is based on the [Ragel state machine compiler](http://www.complang.org/ragel/).
The ragel script is located in the src/ragel directory. Ragel binaries for OS X, Linux and Win32
is precompiled and stored in /src/ragel/bin/. The makefile is set up to reference the
correct binary when compiling on Linux or OS X.

Ragel was designed and written by Adrian Thurston and released under the
[GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt) in 2002. Sosicon relies heavily
on the excellent work of Thurston and [his team of contributors](http://www.complang.org/ragel/CREDITS).
