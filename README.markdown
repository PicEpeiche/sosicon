# Sosicon v 0.1 (under development)
For Linux, OS X and Windows. Converts SOSI files to a number of other formats, including shapefile.
The parser is still under development.

SOSI is a data format used for exchanging geographical information in Norway. The name is an acronym
for _"Samordnet Opplegg for Stedfestet Informasjon"_, which translates into something like
_"Coordinated Approach for Geospatial Information"_. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOSI)
has more.

## Features
*  Swift conversion
*  Selectable feature/objtype/field export
*  Supports command-line piping on OS X/Linux
*  Written in ANSI C++
*  Compiles and runs on OS X, Linux and Windows

## Quick demo
To convert a SOSI file to shape, run sosicon from the directory where the SOSI file
resides. Use the -2shp parameter to emit the three required files for the shapefile format.
Use the -o parameter to specify output file name and the -g parameter to select the type
of geometry to export.

`sosicon -2shp -g FLATE -o my_output input.sos`

On Linux and OS X, batch conversion is supported by piping:

`ls *.sos | sosicon -2shp -g FLATE`

The above command will convert every *.sos file in current directory to corresponding shapefiles.
The files will be written to the same directory with the same file title with tsv extension.

## Development
Sosicon is not ready for release, although TSV conversion works well with some SOSI features like
address points. The parser needs to be extended to include more features in accordance with the
SOSI specification.

## Source documentation
Documentation exists in html, rtf and pdf formats. See the doc directory within the repository or visit [sosicon.espenandersen.no](http://sosicon.espenandersen.no/) for an online version.

The source code documentation for sosicon is generated by the brilliant [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) code documentation tool written by Dimitri van Heesch.

### Ragel parser
The parser in sosicon is based on the [Ragel state machine compiler](http://www.complang.org/ragel/).
The ragel script is located in the src/ragel directory. Ragel binaries for OS X, Linux and Win32
is precompiled and stored in /src/ragel/bin/. The makefile is set up to reference the
correct binary when compiling on Linux or OS X.

Ragel was designed and written by Adrian Thurston and released under the
[GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt) in 2002. Sosicon relies heavily
on the excellent work of Thurston and [his team of contributors](http://www.complang.org/ragel/CREDITS).
